Scrumforce is a Salesforce.com app that provides the ability to manage SCRUM agile projects.

Various records can be entered to portray the types information within a SCRUM team namely:
	- Epic- A large User Story, generally too big to fit into a single Sprint. Useful for high level 'road map'/ 'release planning'.
	- Theme â€“ A set of related User Stories. Useful for high level 'road map' / 'release planning'.
	- Work - Includes 'User Stories' as well as Bugs and other items that may not have originated from the Product Backlog.
	- Work Task - Sprint Backlog Tasks for a piece of Work.
	- Sprint - A collection of pieces of Work to be worked on over a period of time.

The system takes care of regular snapshots of rolled up Sprint information (i.e., remaining points and hours)
which are stored as 'Sprint Burndowns' and then charted on the Sprint page layout.

As much as possible standard Salesforce platform functionality has been used to create this application and Apex
development has been only used as necessary.

IN PROGRESS:
	- A Virtual Wall to drag and drop Work Tasks to update status as well as edit Work Task information
